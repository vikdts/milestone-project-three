# Minesweeper

Minesweeper is a classic and popular online puzzle single-player game. It is all age-appropriate. This is not the classic version, which offers clues with numbers of neighboring mines. The outcome depends on random events, to clear the board without detonating any mines.
The game begins with an introduction to the game rules and a selection of a difficulty level, beginner intermediate, or expert, which is based on the grid size. 

Once selected the difficulty level, it renders a board with the hidden cells all marked with '0'. The user is prompted to choose a cell to dig, by giving an input, according to the
row and column number. If correct and no mine was detonated, a message will indicate to 
continue with a new location to dig and the board will be rendered with the cleared cell,
marked with '-'. However, if the user guesses incorrectly, there will be rendered a message
for hitting a mine. All difficulty levels are given three lives, so the user will be prompted
to choose to continue the game or quit. In order to win the player has to clear the board,
before running out of lives.

Minesweeper is an interesting and familiar game, that keeps the player engaged, based on simple guessing skills. It is a great way to have some fun and mine-out!

## How to play

In this implementation of Minesweeper, you will be prompted to
choose a difficulty level, based on the grid size. The computer will
render a board either 5x5, 7x7, or 10x10 according to the level of difficulty,
and randomly distribute mines, corresponding their number to the grid size.
You will have to guess all the coordinates, avoiding stepping on the mines,
to clear the board without detonating any mines and win the game.

## User Experience

Minesweeper is a classic game, this version is presented very minimalistic,
with a basic board created by the hidden cells, all marked with a '0'.
On the left side of the board, there are the numbers from 0 to the number
size of the grid minus one, corresponding to the difficulty level, separated
by a dashed line - representing the rows, and the columns are numbered the same
way on the top of the board, again separated by a dashed line. The numbers
are the main guide for the user to input the coordinates of the chosen cell.
Once a valid input is given the board is printed again, updated with either a
'-' for non-mined cells or the '*' hitting one. The user is given three lives
each game and can continue, after stepping on a mine, till running out of 
lives or win the game. The game is very easy to follow and have fun.

## Fixed Bugs
- Negative integers were considered in the play function in order to
raise ValueError, if given unrelevant input
- User input in the recursive validation function was set to lower to
to avoid case sensitive bugs and give the better user experience
