Once selected the difficulty level, it renders a board with the hidden cells all marked with '0'. The user is prompted to choose a cell to dig, by giving an input, according to the
row and column number. If correct and no mine was detonated, a message will indicate to 
continue with new location to dig and the board, will be rendered with the cleared cell,
marked with '-'. However, if the user guesses incorrectly, there will be rendered a message
for hitting a mine. All difficulty levels are given three lives, so the user will be propted
to choose to continue the game or quit. In ordered to win the player has to clear the board,
before running out of lives.
